1
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:11,761
Chandler: I'm moving out, so you're
in charge of paying the rent.

2
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,091
Joey: When's it due?
Chandler: On the first.

3
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:15,685
Joey: And that's every month?

4
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,488
Chandler: No, just the months
you want to live here.

5
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:21,929
Chandler: Okay, here's the phone bill.

6
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:24,571
Joey: Oh, my God!

7
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:27,524
Chandler: That's our phone number.

8
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:32,004
Chandler: I know I kind of sprung this
me-moving-out-on-you thing.

9
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:35,642
Chandler: Why don't I cover you for a while?
Joey: No way!

10
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,929
Joey: Joey Tribbiani does not
take charity...

11
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:40,761
Joey: ...anymore.

12
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,364
Chandler: It's not charity, Joe.
Joey: Forget it.

13
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,762
Joey: Thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.

14
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:49,930
Joey: I can take care of myself.
What's next? Come on.

15
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:51,571
Chandler: Here's the electric bill.

16
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:55,202
Joey: This is how much we pay for electric?
Chandler: -Well, yeah.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,611
Chandler: So we'll do
the rest of the bills later, then?

20
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,962
Phoebe: Will Joey have to give up
the apartment?

21
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:44,362
Chandler: I offered him money,
but he wouldn't take it.

22
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:45,965
Phoebe: How much does he need?

23
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,561
Chandler: $1500 would cover him
for a few months...

24
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:52,367
Chandler: ...but I have to trick him into
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,568
Phoebe: Why don't you hire him as an actor?

26
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:59,645
Phoebe: You could have him dress up
and put on skits whenever you want.

27
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:03,966
Chandler: Well, that would help the pride thing.

28
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:10,121
Chandler: Wow, you look great! Do you wanna
move in with me tomorrow?

29
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:14,811
Chandler: Any plans for tonight?

30
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,407
Monica: Instead of being sad on my
last night with Rachel...

31
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:21,440
Monica: ...we're going out to celebrate
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

32
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:24,729
Phoebe: And also my birthday.
Monica: It's not your birthday.

33
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:30,008
Phoebe: What a mean thing to say! I'd never
tell you it wasn't your birthday.

34
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,650
Phoebe: You guys have anything planned
for the big last night?

35
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:39,441
Chandler: Instead of just hanging out,
we figure we'd do nothing.

36
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:45,370
Ross: Knicks' season opener tonight.
I thought you'd come and watch it.

37
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:46,886
Joey: I don't know, Ross.

38
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:50,841
Joey: Not if you talk about how you gave up
basketball to become a paleontologist.

39
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:55,449
Ross: I did give up a career in basketball
to become a paleontologist!

40
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:58,282
Rachel: Pheebs--
Monica: You're not dressed yet?

41
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,171
Monica: We're supposed to start having fun
in 15 minutes!

42
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:05,010
Rachel: And clearly, not a minute sooner.

43
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:09,207
Monica: You are packed, though, right?
Please tell me you're packed?

44
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:12,489
Rachel: Of course I'm packed.
Monica, relax.

45
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:15,007
Rachel: I wanted to ask Phoebe
what I should wear.

46
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:17,686
Phoebe: My God, I can't get a minute of peace.

47
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,089
Phoebe: Oh, my God!

48
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:27,207
Phoebe: Monica's just gonna kill you.

49
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:28,521
Rachel: I know.

50
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:30,763
Phoebe: What you're wearing is fine
for that.

51
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,485
Monica: You're not packed!

52
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:39,367
Monica: You're not packed even a little bit!

53
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:41,680
Rachel: Surprise!

54
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,808
Rachel: Don't get mad,
because this is what happened.

55
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:49,362
Rachel: I started packing,
then I realized, "What am I doing?"

56
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:52,211
Rachel: I am lousy at packing, right?

57
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,091
Rachel: But you love packing!

58
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:58,086
Rachel: So as a gift to you
on our last night... .

59
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,410
Monica: I'll be coordinator!

60
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:07,883
Monica: Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

61
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,766
Monica: Everybody has to help.
Phoebe, can you help?

62
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,240
Phoebe: I have plans.

63
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:15,047
Monica: You have plans with us.
Phoebe: That's right.

64
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,285
Monica: Chandler can make boxes, Ross can
wrap, and Joey can lift.

65
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:21,568
Monica: Tell the guys
they have to help out.

66
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,484
Monica: My God, thank you!

67
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,201
Phoebe: Monica's gonna make you pack!
She's got jobs for everyone!

68
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:30,649
Phoebe: Now, it's too late for me,
but save yourselves!

69
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:35,964
Monica: The movers will be here in 11 hours.
Rachel hasn't packed.

70
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:38,089
Monica: Now, everybody has to help.
Chandler--

71
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:40,129
Chandler: I have plans with Joey.

72
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:44,805
Monica: You said you were doing nothing.
Chandler: Yes, but for the last time.

73
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,805
Monica: Fine. Now, Ross--

74
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:50,282
Ross: I can't do it.
Monica: Why not?

75
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:53,888
Joey: Don't you have Ben?
Ross: Because I have Ben!

76
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:57,360
Monica: It's almost past his bedtime.
Where is he?

77
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:58,925
Chandler: He's at a dinner party.

78
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,852
Monica: He's really coming?
I can see in your apartment.

79
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:06,162
Ross: Of course he is. What?

80
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,880
Ross: You think I'd use my son as an excuse?

81
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,322
Ross: What kind of father do you think I am?

82
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,047
Monica: All right. Sorry.

83
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:16,123
Ross: I gotta go make a fake Ben.

84
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:21,482
Joey: Here it is.

85
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,166
Joey: Our last pizzas together as roommates.

86
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:26,681
Chandler: I wish I knew that.
I ordered Chinese.

87
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:28,490
Joey: Well, that's okay.

88
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:31,007
Joey: In a way it's kind of nice.
You know?

89
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:35,040
Joey: Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors...

90
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,362
Chandler: ...you, the food of yours!

91
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:44,446
I had an idea for what to do
on our last night.

92
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,490
Chandler: What do you say we play a little
foosball for money?

93
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:51,566
Joey: Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me
since my injury-plagued '97 season.

94
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:55,327
Joey: It'd be easier to give me your money.
Chandler: Yes, it would.

95
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:58,325
Chandler: What do you say to $50?

96
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:00,563
Joey: You're on.
Chandler: Okay, let's play.

97
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,603
Chandler: The big game. Italy versus...

98
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,285
Chandler: ...China, apparently.
